        The two proposed projects are the following:

        <ol>
          <li> <h4> Autonomous Grasping of Objects based on Visual
              Information </h4>
            
            <p>
              For this project the Sawyer robot will be used in its
              position-controlled mode, as well as one or two cameras. All the
              project will be implemented using ROS and Open CV for obtaining
              adequate information from the camera(s). The position and
              orientation of the end-effector will be controlled using any
              method of choice, which can be inverse kinematics, differential
              kinematics, inverse dynamics, etc.  <p />

            <p> There must be one or two cameras fixed in the environment,
              which will be used to detect the object and which can also be
              used to provide a finer feedback for grasping (visual
              servoing). The system must be trained to recognize at least three
              different objects (e.g. cups, bottles). These objects will be
              randomly positioned on a table. The user will only specify which
              object the robot must grasp, but neither the position nor the
              orientation of the object will be specified. The robot must be
              able to recognize the object, grasp it, and move it to another
              predefined location.
            </p>

          <li> <h4> Autonomous Motion of a Mobile Robot </h4>

            <p>
              For this project the Kobuki differential mobile robot will be
              used. The Kobuki robots in the lab are currently controlled with
              another proprietary board, but for this project a microcomputer
              such as a Raspberry Pi will be used, instead, to control the
              mobile robot. This needs some additional wiring to provide energy
              to the microcomputer using the outputs of the
              Kobuki. Alternatively, any other mobile robot can be used as long
              as the motors are velocity controlled.
            </p>

            <p>
              There must be one or two cameras fixed at the top of the
              environment in order to provide an estimation of the map where
              the robot will move. Random obstacles will be located in the
              environment. The robot will be left somewhere on the environment,
              and the user will specify the point the robot should move to but
              not the path that it will follow. The robot should autonomously
              find the path and move in the environment without colliding with
              objects. It is desired, but not mandatory, to provide the system
              with the ability to reconfigure itself even in a dynamic
              environment (when the obstacles change their position).
            </p>

        </ol>

        <p>
        If you are interested in doing another project, you can also propose it
        during the lab session, and its feasibility will be discussed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The deadline for the project presentation is on July 7 at 10 am. The
          demo and the presentation will be at that time. The grade of the
          project will have the following components:
          <ul>
            <li> (20%) Oral presentation of the project
            <li> (30%) A paper (4 to 6 pages) in IEEE format (written in MS
              Word or LaTeX) but submitted in pdf format.
            <li> (20%) A video showing the results of the project
            <li> (30%) The demo of the project
          </ul>
          The paper should follow the format of a conference paper:
          introduction, methodology, results, conclusions. Note that you do not
          need to have a specific methodology section, but it can be split into
          other sections with specific names, in case it is needed.
